# (2,2)_GB-Codes_Classification
This repository provides a comprehensive classification of (2,2)-Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes, of length less than 200. This work rigorously identifies these codes up to an equivalence relation compatible with their CSS code structures and Cayley graph properties.

## About Generalized Bicycle (GB) Codes
(2,2)-Generalized Bicycle codes are a specialized type of CSS codes derived from from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two non-zero elements per row, intrinsically linked to Cayley graphs. 
They are known for their efficient encoding and decoding properties, making them promising candidates for practical quantum error correction. 


## Classification Methodology
The equivalence relation used in this classification corresponds to 2-isomorphisms between the underlying Cayley graphs.
Our classification focused exclusively on elementary GB codes of the form $GB(1 + X^a, 1 + X^b, n)$ with $gcd(a, b, n) = 1$, as these serve as the fundamental building blocks for all (2,2)-GB codes. The computational aspects were performed using **SageMath** and **Magma**. SageMath was utilized for determining equivalence classes of isomorphic graphs and evaluating their k-connectivity. Magma was employed for computing the minimum distance of the quantum codes. For codes with identical parameters, manual verification for non-2-isomorphism was conducted by checking 3-connectivity of underlying graphs (where applicable, per Whitney's Theorem on 3-connected graphs) or by verifying non-permutation equivalence of row spaces of incidence matrices.


## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
- `scripts/`: Contains SageMath and Magma scripts used for graph isomorphism checking, k-connectivity analysis and minimum distance computation of quantum codes.
- `results_data/`: Processed lists of classified codes.
- `README.md`: This file.
  

## How to Use/Reproduce
To reproduce the results or utilize the scripts in this repository, you will need:
-   **SageMath:** accessible via JupyterNotebook
-   **Magma:** https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/
  

## Results
The main outcomes of this classification are detailed in the `results_data/` file. This includes a comprehensive list of distinct (2,2)-GB codes, presented for each set of parameters [[2n, 2, d]] with n ranging from 1 to 100. For any given parameter set, we provide all non-equivalent GB codes corresponding to it.
